# hello-world
practice and notes
I wanna learn, but first i gotta learn how to learn
My head is like a holy cheese, it holds stuff like a hand holds sand...
I need to patch up those holes so i can add new content without losing it immediately
Then, i need shelves in there to organize what i put in
But first things first: hole-patching!
